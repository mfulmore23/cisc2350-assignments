I am not sure if you guys realize it yet but one thing about myself is that I have a strong passion for sports and football in particular. This past semester in my Digital Media and Public Responsibility course, I wrote three essays about the relationship between Twitter and Football that I would like to share with you guys.


<h2>All About the Money</h2>
<br>

In the first report I spoke largely about the history of Twitter and the history of football and introduced a few ideas about how the two interact with one another other.
The link between Twitter and football, as we know it today, has increased the brand of the NFL; as well as changed the way we look at college football. 

The connection between Twitter and football was not a love at first sight kind of relation. Twitter has been around since 2006 but the National Football League took its time cementing its presence on Twitter. In general, “the NFL doesn’t like to share when it comes to the content it licenses to television networks for billions of dollars each year.” (Van Grove) But in today’s social media era, the NFL had no choice but to adapt to the world’s digital landscape and use twitter as an asset. With football being the most popular sport in America, a lot of passionate fans come along with that. Fans are an important aspect to the brand of football. Twitter has given fans, at both the collegiate and professional level, the ability to connect and feel involved with their teams more than ever. College and NFL teams have turned to social media as a way of providing their fans with immediate game updates, information regarding particular players or management within the organizations, and as well as interaction with fans. These are common some connections we see with other sports and other social media platforms.

To separate their league from the competition, the NFL wanted to do more. This past season the National Football League and Twitter partnered in two major ways in effort to increase fan engagement, reach a larger audience, and ultimately bring in more money. First, they partnered up for a series of NFL-themed hashtags and emojis. There are designated (some creative) hashtags for all 32 teams and a little imagine of the team’s logo shows up when the hashtag is used. For example, if I tweeted, “GoPackGo,” the Green Bay Packers logo would appear next to the hashtag. This keeps conversations centralized and easy to access, allowing fans of the same or opposing team to engage on Twitter. Individual teams have also found ways to gain followers on Twitter by using creative hashtags to engage fans. For example, the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles came up with their own hashtags to connect with fans. Creating hashtags such as #TomTuesday on Tuesdays (Tom for Tom Brady of the Patriots) or #WentzDay on Wednesdays (Wentz for Carson Wentz of the Eagles), where they offer fans a chance to win signed memorabilia based on how many retweets the post gets. (Platt) During the regular season, the New England Patriots also utilize the hashtag #HardCorePatsFan; where they encourage fans to tweet pictures of their Patriot loyalty and the team will award a lucky winner with tickets to an upcoming home game. (Platt) Tactics like these benefit the organization by reaching a larger audience and keeps the fans more interested on Twitter. 
<br>
<br>
In 2016, the National Football League and Twitter announced and launched a streaming partnership for Thursday Night Football. Generally, NFL games are played on Sundays but in 2006 the NFL launched Thursday Night Football with a total of eight games on NFL Network and have expanded ever since and now there is one Thursday Night game every week throughout the season. (Sandritter) But last year the NFL selected Twitter as its “exclusive partner to deliver a live digital stream of Thursday Night Football to a global audience across devices and for free during the course of the 2016 NFL regular season.” (Riethmiller) In addition to live streaming video of NFL game action, the partnership includes in-game highlights from Thursday Night Football as well as pre-game Periscope broadcasts from players and teams, giving fans a brand new experience before, during and after games. According to the NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, “Twitter is where live events unfold and is the right partner for the NFL as we take the latest step in serving fans around the world live NFL football.” Last year, the National Football League’s experiment of letting Twitter live stream Thursday Night Games saw positive results but their deal was not renewed. For this upcoming season, the NFL announced a partnership with Amazon who has bought the rights to the league’s streaming package, and will offer the games for free to its Amazon Prime subscribers around the world. (Kafka) Other outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube also expressed interest in a partnership but Amazon offered a price the National Football League could not deny. Amazon is paying around $50 million for the10 games it will show next fall, which is a big increase from the $10 million Twitter paid last year. A key aspect about this deal is that Amazon does not have exclusive streaming rights for the games. CBS and NBC will also have the ability to stream the games they broadcast, and Verizon will stream the game to its wireless subscribers. (Kafka) This deal is important for Amazon because it’s their first significant venture into live streaming. This will obviously affect Twitter because they were looking to renew their deal after last year’s results.  
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the decision to have live stream football games on Twitter and even have Thursday Night Football games is all about money. In the past, advertisers were more confident knowing that a large portion of their target audience would perceive the commercials they ran on TV during games. But that confidence has begun to deflate in the past few years as mobile devices and social media have taken over. “Today’s typical TV viewer is a multi-tasker, switching between their smartphone, tablet, laptop, and television as many as 27 times per hour.” (Zafar) 
<br>

The relation between the NFL and Twitter doesn’t end when the actual season does either. During the offseason, there are many importance events where the NFL leveraged Twitter to increase engagement with fans. For example, the start of NFL free agency, the NFL Scouting Combine, and the NFL Draft. The NFL free agency is the period where NFL teams are allowed to negotiate and sign players with expired contracts. During this time, the media and fans of various teams are constantly tweeting about the prospects of signing particular players. The NFL scouting combine, is a 4-day event held in Indianapolis, Indiana where a large group of collegiate athletes are selected to participate in a “job interview” for the NFL. These players are put through a number of tests and drills in-front of NFL coaches and scouts, as well as on national television. During the combine, fans, former and currents players, and the media regularly tweet about the results they see. During this past year’s combine, we saw a huge spike in tweets due to the 40-yard dash record being broken. John Ross, from the University of Washington, broke Chris Johnson’s 40-yard dash record (4.25) by running it in 4.22 seconds. After the record was broken, current and former players showed their respect for Ross and fans showed their appreciation as well. His talent and buzz on Twitter led to immediate business opportunities and a few days later he signed an endorsement deal with Nike. Lastly, the NFL Draft is probably the biggest event of the three, where NFL teams select a number of players from college for their team. The NFL Draft is one of the most exciting times for football fans around the world. Fans are eager to see whom their respective team selects or where their favorite college athletes lands and they use twitter to show their excitement. Other than the Super Bowl, the NFL draft is where you see the most volume of tweets on Twitter. When you combine all the media who give their inputs on picks, team’s and the NFL account whom announce the picks, and as well as the fans it’s easy to see why the number of tweets about football increases. All of this attention bodes well for the players because once they are drafted to a team; they see an increase of twitter followers. For example, in the 2015 NFL draft, three players drafted in the top ten saw a dramatic jump in twitter followers. Jameis Winston, Amari Cooper, and Todd Gurley were all big time college football players who already had over 100,000 followers before the draft. But on draft night and the days after, the three saw close to an increase of about 20,000 followers respectively.

<br>
As an active Twitter user, this is the place to be during the draft. Fans are giving their outrageous opinions on the players their team drafts and it can be very entertaining. Majority of the time, draft picks are announced to the world on Twitter before they are broadcasted on national television. Over the past two years, there have been major incidents involving three prospects, Laremy Tunsil, Joe Mixon, and Gareon Conley, that occurred before the draft that have affected where these players were drafted. Tunsil, an offensive lineman from the University of Mississippi, was projected to be a top ten drafted pick but minutes before the draft a video of him wearing a gas mask and smoking a substance from a bong surfaced on his twitter account. His account was hacked it led to him falling to the 13th spot in the draft and he lost out on about 8 million dollars. Joe Mixon, running back from the University of Oklahoma, was regarded as a top five running back in this year’s draft class but was charged to a misdemeanor assault charge in 2014 for punching a woman in self-defense. This graphic video also surfaced on twitter and he received a lot of backlash on twitter and there was a lot of debate whether Mixon would even be drafted due to character issues. He ended up being drafted in the 2nd round to the Cincinnati Bengals. Lastly, just days prior to the 2017 NFL draft news surfaced on twitter that Gareon Conley, top defensive back in the draft from Ohio State University, was accused of rape. He strongly denied the claims but it was speculated that the allegations would drop him out of the first round. Days later, he drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the first round. With these three events that take place during the offseason, fans remained involved and this showcases the importance of social media in the NFL’s overall growth. 
<br>
<br>
For the college game, Twitter has changed the way college coaches recruit players. I will not say everyone but majority of kids throughout the country have an active Twitter account and coaches have used that to their advantage. For example, as I was going through the recruiting process in high school, coaches would contact me and I would reach out to different coaches around the country through Facebook. There is no difference with Twitter, as long as you know the person’s Twitter handle, you can reach him. Also, twitter has changed the way high school prospects have committed to a school. Before the social media era, most players would simply make their commitment to a college or university either over the phone or in the office of that school. But in today’s world, athletes have gone to Twitter to announce their future school with a tweet or an outrageous video. People have their opinions on whether they feel that which way is right or wrong but everyone can agree that Twitter has changed the way athletes go about making their commitment. 
<br>
<br>
Over the past few years, the NFL and teams around the league have found ways to use Twitter as a major asset. By using various hashtags, digital streaming, and simply talking about football, fans are more involved with their team then ever before. At the same time, NFL’s brand is continuously growing and they are bringing in more money, which is ultimately what the commissioner cares about. As the Twitter and football relationship continues to grow and find new ways to coincide with one another, I feel that we will see more fan engagement and more money being made.
