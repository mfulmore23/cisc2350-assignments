<h2>5.  Mr. Clutch Sends Lakers and Knicks to OT with 60-Foot Shot in 1970 Finals</h2>
<br>
<p>
If the NBA had instituted the three-point shot 10 years earlier, the Los Angeles Lakers may well have another title about which to boast and Jerry West might have more than one on his resume as a player.
<br>
With time running out on Game 3 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, West launched a 60-foot shot from beyond half court that found its way into the opposing hoop at the buzzer. That sent the game into overtime, from which the Knicks emerged with a 111-108 win.
<br>
But if the three-point arc had been around back then, West's Hail Mary make would've resulted in a Lakers win. And who knows? Maybe L.A. would've gone on to win the series before Willis Reed had a chance to rally his team's spirits on one leg (more on that later).
<br>
And, maybe, West's most memorable shot would've wound up higher on this list. Alas, R. Kelly, there is no turning back the hands of time.
</p>
<h2>4."HAVLICEK STOLE THE BALL!"</h2>
<p>
The 1965 Eastern Division finals may well be the greatest series ever played in which the NBA title wasn't directly on the line. You had a meeting of historic rivals between Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. You had two teams loaded with Hall of Famers on the fringes—Tommy Heinsohn, John Havlicek, Tom "Satch" Sanders, Sam Jones and KC Jones for the C's; Hal Greer and Chet Walker for the Sixers.
<br>
As it happens, though, the real star of the series turned out to be Boston broadcasting legend Johnny Most. It was Most whose raspy vocals lent life to one of the most iconic radio calls in sports—"HAVLICEK STOLE THE BALL!"
<br>
Of course, Most probably wouldn't have been quite as emphatic if Havlicek's theft of Hal Greer's pass hadn't sealed a Game 7 victory for the Celtics. In any case, Boston to win its seventh of eight straight titles by way of a five-game series victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1965 NBA Finals.
</p>
<br>

<h2>3. Willis Reed Rallies Knicks to First NBA Title</h2>
<p>
In purely statistical terms, Willis Reed didn't do much during Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals. He scored just four points on two shots in the New York Knicks' 113-99 victory.
<br>
Which, compared to Walt Frazier's 36 points and 19 assists, seemed forgettable at best.
<br>
Except nobody expected Reed to even step on to the court that night. He'd missed Game 6 of that series against the Los Angeles Lakers after tearing a muscle in his right thigh during Game 5. The guy could barely walk, much less play a game of professional basketball.
<br>
And yet, there he was, limping out onto the floor at Madison Square Garden, jumping center against Wilt for the opening tip—the pain in Reed's leg dulled by a pregame injection, the adrenaline in his body and the roar of a raucous crowd of New Yorkers. 
<br>
Those two baskets of Willis' may seem inconsequential in relation to the final score, but they were the first two of the game for New York and served to rally the rest of the Knicks to the franchise's first NBA championship.
</p>
<h2>2. Magic Does It All to Lift Lakers to 1980 Title</h2>
<p>
There's nothing about Magic Johnson's performance in Game 6 of the 1980 NBA Finals that isn't still remarkable to this day.
<br>
Now, scoring 45 points, ripping down 15 rebounds and dishing seven assists would've been enough to land Magic in the pantheon of great performances. Since 1986, only one player (Charles Barkley) has matched or exceeded that output, and that came in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals.
<br>
Not a clinching Game 6 of the NBA Finals, as was the case with Johnson's virtuoso performance, which gave the Lakers the first of their five titles captured during the 1980s. Not in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who didn't even board the pregame flight to Philadelphia on account of a sprained ankle. Not while switching between all five positions throughout the game, as Magic did.
<br>
And not as a 20-year-old rookie, which Magic was at the time he stepped into the shoes of a player who'd already established himself as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.
</p>
<h2>1. Michael Jordan's Final Shot with the Bulls</h2>
<p>
So how is it that Magic Johnson's best playoff game doesn't register as the No. 1 moment in NBA postseason history?
<br>
Because Michael Jordan's deciding shot over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz may well be the most perfect moment in the decorated career of the greatest basketball player who's yet set foot in the Association.
<br>
But it wasn't just the shot itself that made this moment special. It was the way a 35-year-old Jordan crossed up a younger Russell, had him stumbling over his own feet, to create the open look. It was Michael's theft on Karl Malone that put the ball in his hands in the first place, with the Chicago Bulls down by one and less than 20 seconds left on the clock. It was MJ's driving layup before that, which accounted for just two of the Bulls' final eight points, all from Michael's hand.
<br>
And it was the 45 points on the evening, in Jordan's last dance as a resident of the Windy City.
<br>
With that shot, that performance, Jordan collected his sixth championship and sixth NBA Finals before riding off into the sunset.
<br>
Which, apparently, proved a dead end when, less than four years later, he resurfaced in a Washington Wizards uniform for an ill-fated second "unretirement." But not even that bit of basketball sacrilege could sully Michael Jordan's perfect moment.
