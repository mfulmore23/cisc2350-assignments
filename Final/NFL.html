<h2>5. Tenneessee Comes Up One Yard Short (2000)</h2>
<p> Another memorable moment was the final play of Super Bowl XXXIV, between the Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams.
<br>
The Rams were holding on to a seven-point lead, 23-16, with the Titans driving down the field in the final minutes of the game. Titans quarterback Steve McNair engineered a drive that brought the Titans all the way down to the Rams 10-yard line with just six second left in the game. There was time for one last play.
<br>
McNair hit wide receiver Kevin Dyson on a slant pattern, and linebacker Mike Jones met Dyson before he could extend his arm and the ball over the goal line. Dyson came up one yard short, the remaining seconds ticked off the clock and the Rams had their first Super Bowl championship.
<br>
That play, now referred to as "The Tackle," had so much drama and tension, that it will have to remain as one of the top moments in NFL history.
</p>
<br>
<h2>4. Giants Wreck Patriots Perfect Season (2007)</h2>
<p>
The New England Patriots were just one step away from matching the Miami Dolphins perfect 1972 season. The Patriots were undefeated in the regular season and playoffs in 2007. All that remained was to defeat the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII, and the Patriots would make history. In fact, they would have won two more games than the Dolphins did. The regular season was now 16 games long, and the Dolphins only had to win 14 games to sweep their season.
<br>
As it was, the Patriots had defeated the Giants 38-35 in the final regular season game of the season, which demonstrated how evenly matched the two teams were. That is why it was somewhat surprising that the Giants were 12-point underdogs coming into the game. The Giants proved their grit and determination by winning three straight playoff games on the road, so they had momentum coming into the game.
<br>
The most famous play of the game was an Eli Manning scramble where he somehow escaped Patriots rushers that had him in their grasp, only to see Manning somehow dance out of the attempted sack and heave an improbable pass down the field. Even more improbable was the way that wide receiver David Tyree trapped the ball against his helmet to secure the catch. A remarkable play for a remarkable game.
<br>
Manning then floated a pass to Plaxico Burress in the end zone with 35 seconds left to play, and the Giants had completed their 17-14 comeback win.
<br>
Interestingly enough, in the two games played between these top two teams that season, they scored an identical number of points, 52-52 against each other. How wild is that?

<h2>3. Super Bowl XXV (1991)</h2>
<p>Super Bowl XXV was one of the most memorable moments in NFL history. The game turned out to be the closest Super Bowl game in history of the event, as no other Super Bowl game before or since has ever been decided by one point. 
<br>
In addition, the game was played while the Gulf War was being waged, so security at the stadium was extremely tight. I should know, as this was the first Super Bowl game I ever attended in person.
<br>
Whitney Houston had her remarkable version of the Star Spangled Banner. The amount of pride in the country was on display all over Tampa Stadium.
<br>
The New York Giants defeated the Buffalo Bills 20-19 when Scott Norwood's 47-yard field goal in the closing seconds of the game sailed wide right. The entire stadium was on their feet to see how the kick would turn out, as the outcome of the game hung in the balance.
<br>
For Giants fans, it was sheer joy all over the stadium when the kick missed. For the Bills fans, it was the first of four-straight tough Super Bowl memories. I will never forget that game, and I am sure the football fans that witnessed it won't forget it either.
<br>
The game will be remembered for the great defensive scheme that defensive coordinator Bill Belichick ordered up to try to contain Jim Kelly and the Bills' hurry up K-Gun offense. It was a classic battle of a strong defense battling against a strong offense. This was a game for the ages.
<br>
One odd note to pass onâ€”ESPN is running a story that ex-Giants star linebacker Lawrence Taylor is auctioning off his Super Bowl ring from this game. The auction will close this weekend. Timing is everything, right?

<h2>2. NFL Helps U.S. Heal After 9/11 (2001)</h2>
<p>
As far as stirring or touching moments go, you would be hard pressed to find anything more moving or touching than the weekend that the NFL games resumed following the tragedy of September 11, 2001.
<br>
When the NFL decided to resume their season, every game played around the country was filled with moments like the one pictured above from the New York Giants at the Kansas City Chiefs on September 23, 2001.
<br>
In this story by Bill Reiter from Fox Sports, he interviews ex-NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for his memories from the entire episode. Taglibue recalls hearing the news of the plane flying in to the World Trade Center, and agonizing over how to properly move forward.
<br>
Tagliabue decided to hold off on playing games, in an attempt to let things start to calm down and stabilize. When the NFL resumed play on September 23, the Giants were met by a loud and emotional greeting from the Kansas City Chiefs' fans. In games played around the league that day, it helped the country to heal a little bit more, as it would with each passing day.
</p>
<h2>1. Miami Dolphoms Reach Perfection (1972)</h2>
<p>
In the modern era of the NFL, there has only been one team that was able to sweep through the entire regular season, as well as sweeping through the playoffs and Super Bowl, to go undefeated for the year. That one team was the1972 Miami Dolphins, and we have reserved our top spot on this list for their unmatched achievement.
<br>
The NFL regular season was still only 14 games in 1972. The Dolphins wound up with a 17-0 record that year, despite losing their starting quarterback Bob Griese to a broken ankle in Week 5, when he was sacked by Deacon Jones of the San Diego Chargers. Backup Earl Morrall stepped in, and capably led the Dolphins from there all the way to the AFC Championship game, until Griese was able to return. Griese led the Dolphins in Super Bowl VII to their championship win.
<br>
The Dolphins didn't blow teams out, but played well enough to win, which is what it's all about anyway. The Dolphins won their three playoff games by a combined total of only 17 points. They beat Cleveland 20-14, beat Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship 21-17 and then beat Washington in the Super Bowl 14-7.
<br>
Miami was led by the running back duo of Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris, wide receiver Paul Warfield and Hall of Fame linemen Jim Langer and Larry Little. The No-Name defense was led by Nick Buoniconti, Bill Stanfill, Dick Anderson and Jake Scott. 
<br>
The 2007 New England Patriots came close to matching the Dolphins. The Patriots went 16-0 in the regular season, only to lose in the Super Bowl to the New York Giants. If the NFL decides to add even more games on to the regular season, it will make it even more difficult for anybody to match the Dolphins' perfect season.
