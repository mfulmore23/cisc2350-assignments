Sports are great. Every year, throughout the entire world, millions of people involve themselves with sports one way or another. Whether it be playing for a team, coaching a team, or simply watching, sports make up a big part of the world we live in today. To be considered one of the greatest moments in sports history, the moment has to be special. It has to be a moment where people rememebered where they were when it happened or when they heard the news. It had to have uplifted a large group of people, and it must be an iconic moment in time that will stand on its own forever.
